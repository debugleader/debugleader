Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
======
My name is abdallah, I am a web developer and I specialize in backend development. I am currently working and studying at the same time which adds a lot of pressure but teaches me how to manage my time. :relaxed: I am completely self-taught and I am trying my best to improve every day. Please, if you'd like to collaborate with me or if you need any help with any language or framework I understand, feel free to contact me via [email address](mailto:alkhassakyabdallah@gmail.com). :wink:
